# Der Swiper

Simple Tinder-like game to practice article memorization in learning German.

## Installation

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes.

1. To run this project, you'll need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.
   You can download Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:WillemW-01/spotifyplus.git
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
$ cd spotify-plus
$ npm install
```

4. Start the development server (use one of the two).

```bash
$ npx expo start
$ npx expo start --tunnel
```

5. If using Expo Go, open Expo Go and select the running dev server. You are ready to use
   the application.

Click on a word deck to play a round. Swipe the card in the direction of the correct
article. If you finished the round with 100% correct, you will move up a progress-level.
If you complete 5 progress levels, you move up a tier. The tiers help to motivate you to
keep on practising.

## Background

While learning German grammar, I realised that the whole grammar system is based on
whether you can recall the gender of the nouns you are referring to. Therefore, I realised
I need to priorise learning the articles more.

This was an idea I had while travelling in the U-bahn one day, where I was struggling to
read content online due to the bad internet connectivity. I realised that if I just had a
simple offline game to play that could help me learn articles would be great, and I tried
to make it one afternoon.

This is the product of ~3 afternoons worth of work. Still many things I need to adjust,
but it is very fun at the moment.
